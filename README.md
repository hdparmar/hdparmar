- 👋 Hi, I’m Harshdeep Parmar
- 🔍 I’m passionate about Embedded Systems & Machine Learning, and continually seeking to blend the two in innovative ways.
- 🚀 Currently, I am diligently working on fine-tuning Riffusion, a project that combines my interests in deep learning and music. Additionally, I am in the process of developing an MQTT broker for intuitive musical instruments, with the goal of harnessing the power of Internet of Things (IoT) for music technology.
- 🤝 I’m open to collaboration on cutting-edge projects involving Edge ML, Diffusion models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for Image & Audio processing. I truly believe in the transformative power of shared knowledge and teamwork.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me and chat about potential collaborations, ideas, or even just to share your thoughts about the future of Machine Learning and Embedded Systems. Reach me at hdp.1798@gmail.com
